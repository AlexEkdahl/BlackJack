Implement betting and winning

Winnings are two for one; for instance: bet 3 pennies get 6 back. Ties with the dealer result in a "break even" where bets return to those who tied, such as in this case where the left player also has 18. The right player only has 17 after hitting their hand, therefore losing their bet.
